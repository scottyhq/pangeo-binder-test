    "\n",
    "Raster data can come in many different formats. One of the most pervasive comments currently is the `GeoTIFF` format which has the extension `.tif`. A `.tif` file stores metadata or attributes about the file as embedded `tif tags`. For instance, your camera might store EXIF tags that describes the make and model of the camera or the date the photo was taken when it saves a `.tif`. A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` image format with additional spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the file\n",
    "as tags. These tags should include the following raster metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Geotransform (defines extent, resolution)\n",
    "2. Coordinate Reference System (CRS)\n",
    "3. Values that represent missing data (`NoDataValue`) \n",
    "\n",
    "Spatially-aware applications such as [QGIS](https://qgis.org) are careful to interpret this metadata appropriately.  If we aren't careful (or are using a raster-editing application that ignores spatial information), we can accidentally strip this spatial metadata.  Photoshop, for example, can edit GeoTiffs, but we'll lose the embedded CRS and geotransform if we save to the same file!\n",

    "\n",
    "When rasters cover very large areas, or are very high resolution, it is convenient to chop them up into discrete tiles that can be reassembled into the full image. This is especially true for interactive web maps where we want to visualize a raster at a resolution appropriate for a given zoom level. If you are looking at the entire globe, there is no reason to render an image at 30m resolution because our eyes can't discern the detail. Conversly if we are zoomed into a city, we want the full resolution data displayed. This schematic illustrates tiling:\n",

There are common standard tiling schemes for web maps - check out the [mercantile library](https://github.com/mapbox/mercantile). GDAL also offers utilities to easily generate tiles from any raster. For example, see [`gdal2tiles.py`](https://gdal.org/programs/gdal2tiles.html)  or the [`MBTiles` format](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/mbtiles.html).\n"
